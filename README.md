# EyeTribeAPI
This is an API for EyeTribe based on Python

In order to construct a user interface for EyeTribe to collect the coordinate data of human eyes when they are watching a series videos, we build this interface based on API provided by [The EyeTribe](http://theeyetribe.com/theeyetribe.com/about/index.html)
